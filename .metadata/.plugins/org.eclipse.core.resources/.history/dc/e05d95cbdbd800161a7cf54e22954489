 * The Game class contains the static methods restart() and step(), which describe

 * You can use the step() method to program in things like the appearance of asteroids
 * that need to happen with certain timing. A new game is always begun by the creation
 * of a new Game object, so that that Game's step() is called first out of all objects.
